TVtool -in inter_subjects_template.nii.gz -fa #creates inter_subjects_template_fa.nii.gz, template FA map in DTI-TK space, fit to the DTI-TK space template (the inter_subjects_template.nii.gz file)

fsl_reg $FSLDIR/data/atlases/JHU/JHU-ICBM-FA-1mm.nii.gz inter_subjects_template_fa.nii.gz atlas_to_DTITK_space -e -FA 
#RESULT: creates 1) warp for atlas to DTI-TK space (atlas_to_DTITK_space_warp.nii.gz), 2) matrix of linear warp (atlas_to_DTITK_space.mat), 3) atlas_to_DTITK_space.msf (don't know what this is)

#note: this warp is very close to the INVERSE of the warp matrix for the inter-subject template TO MNI/FSL space, but we don't want to have to create that warp and then just make an inverse of it and then apply it to the atlas
#so we are DIRECTLY creating a warp from atlas to DTI-TK space and then applying it to the atlas (next step)

applywarp -i $FSLDIR/data/atlases/JHU/JHU-ICBM-labels-1mm.nii.gz -o JHU_in_FA_inter_subjects_template -r inter_subjects_template_fa.nii.gz -w atlas_to_DTITK_space_warp.nii.gz -d float -s --superlevel=a --interp=nn 
#RESULT: outputs "JHU_in_FA_inter_subjects_template.nii.gz", a map of colorful (grayscale) ROIs of white matter tracts that are in your inter-template DTI-TK space 
#this will apply the warp, which was outputted by previous fsl_reg step, to the LABELs atlas so that you can extract ROIs from
#note: want to set interpolation to nearest neighbor to get strict boundaries between different ROIs in the atlas

#further note: JHU-ICBM-FA-1mm.nii.gz is an FA map in MNI/FSL space, JHU-ICBM-labels-1mm.nii.gz is a map of labeled colorful ROIs of white matter tracts you can use to extract ROI volumes from your images 

#you want to use the 1x1x1mm isotropic atlas instead of the 2x2x2 (smaller than the size of your template's voxels) --> ie you are taking the atlas and making the voxel size BIGGER (rather than taking your subject's DTI FA images and making their voxels larger)

# BEFORE starting following steps, I would suggest making a copy of all DTI...aff_diffeo_FA.nii.gz and the atlas in DTITK space, in case you do something wrong 
#in terminal, unzip the DTI...aff_diffeo_FA.nii.gz files for each participant, and the JHU_to_FA_inter_subjects_template.nii.gz that has all the ROIs in it, so you can use spm on them
